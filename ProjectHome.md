This is a simple automatic trading program which uses alerts from Trade-Ideas to enter and exit trades.  It is deliberately constructed to mimic the Trade-Ideas OddsMaker, making it easy for traders to develop strategies, test them and then go live.


This is an early release and there may be major bugs remaining.  Users are encouraged to avoid trading with real their real account.

Strategies which are profitable in OddsMaker may not be profitable when trading live.  Traders are fully responsible for any trades through their account and it is their responsibility to understand all of the implications.
